# What is the IBM PingMaster?
The IBM PingMaster is a keyboard made by IBM during the 1980s for the Chinese and Japanese market. This keyboard uses vintage green switches and has a strange connection cable that is like a 9-pin VGA cable but with only 4-pins. Also, this keyboard has built in speakers and a volume numb for that speaker which allows you to determine the volume of the speaker as well as allow the keyboard to beep every time you hit a key. I have no idea why this beeping feature was made, but its unique and different. To learn more about this keyboard, just Google it or check out this video by Chyrosran22: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfyOs694lpU.

# What type of converter is this?
The Converter I made is a converter that you connect to the cable of the IBM PingMaster. Some people have removed the orginal cable all to gether but I just wanted to make the converter an add on without physically changing the keyboard's orginal design.

# Required Hardware:
  1) IBM PingMaster Keyboard
  2) Pro Micro Board
  3) Wires or female to female/male cables
  4) (optional) 9-Pin VGA Female Head

# Steps:
1) Wire up the Pro Mircro Board. You can wire it directly to the cable's pin using female to female/male cables or by using a 9-pin VGA Female Head. Look at the diagram below to for the wiring:
