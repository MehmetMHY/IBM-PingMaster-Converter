# What is the IBM PingMaster?
The IBM PingMaster is a keyboard made by IBM during the 1980s for the Chinese and Japanese market. This keyboard uses vintage green switches and has a strange connection cable that is like a 9-pin VGA cable but with only 4-pins. Also, this keyboard has built in speakers and a volume numb for that speaker which allows you to determine the volume of the speaker as well as allow the keyboard to beep every time you hit a key. I have no idea why this beeping feature was made, but its unique and different. To learn more about this keyboard, just Google it or check out this video by Chyrosran22: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfyOs694lpU.

# What type of converter is this?
The Converter I made is a converter that you connect to the cable of the IBM PingMaster. Some people have removed the orginal cable all to gether but I just wanted to make the converter an add on without physically changing the keyboard's orginal design.

# Required Hardware:
  1) IBM PingMaster Keyboard
  2) Pro Micro Board
  3) Wires or female to female/male cables
  4) (optional) 9-Pin VGA Female Head

# Steps:
1) Wire up the Pro Mircro Board. You can wire it directly to the cable's pin using female to female/male cables or by using a 9-pin VGA Female Head. Look at the diagram below to for the wiring:

2) After wiring everything up, create your Hex file. This hex file will be the layout of the keyboard which you can design though the following website: http://www.tmk-kbd.com/tmk_keyboard/editor/unimap/?ibm4704_usb_rev1_alps. So basically design you layout though this website, then download it.

3) When you have your file's layout, you need to upload the file to the Pro Micro Board. To do this, download and set up a tool called QMK ToolBox from the following GitHub link: https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox. 

4) When the QMK ToolBox is setup, click the *open* and go to the directory of the Hex file you downloaded from step 2. Underneath the Microcontroller text, select atmega32u4. It might be different for you, so you might have to check what your micrcocontroller is though the terminal. Check out the Useful Links if you get confused.

5) Before doing this step, dont connect your IBM PingMaster to your Pro Micro Board yet and read all of step 5 before doing it. After getting everything setup, plug your Pro Micro Board (from the micro usb cable) into your computer with the QMK Toolbox running. Then immediately reset your Pro Micro Board by short circuiting the board. To reset it, please look at the diagram below or SparkFun linked listed in *Useful links*. After reseting it, you MOST immediately hit the FLASH button in QMK Toolbox. If this works, you should get a *successful* message of some short. If this does not work. Redo step 5 again. If it keeps failing, please check out the *Useful links* below.

6) After step 5, connect your IBM PingMaster to your converter.

7) Then, test your converter by raising the keyboard's volume nob and typing. Make sure that the speaker works when you type. Also, visit the following website to test and make sure all the keys work: http://keyboardchecker.com/.

8) Finally, after finishing all the steps, enjoy your IBM PingMaster!
