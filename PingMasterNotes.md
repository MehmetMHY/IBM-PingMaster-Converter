### December 2018:
- Gathered interest in the IBM PingMaster keyboard from YouTube Videos

### March 2019:
- Purchased the IBM PingMaster from eBay for $40 which is the total cost after eBay’s $5 coupon.
- Tested and create the IBM PingMaster Converter using the Pro Micro, wires, and a Micro USB to USB 2.0 cable.
- Started using the IBM PingMaster as my main keyboard
- Added to extended legs to the back of the IBM PingMaster to give it a better angle for my typing experience.
- I started “taping” the rubber legs of the IBM PingMaster to keep the rubber clean as well as make it easier to move the keyboard around on my desk.

### August 2019:
- I decided to change the cable on the IBM PingMaster due to the cable being really heavily, tough, and difficult to work with.

### September 2019:
- Purchased a silver-colored threaded Micro USB to USB 3.0 cable from eBay to act as the main cable for the replacing of the IBM PingMaster cable change project.
- First Attempt of replacing the IBM PingMaster cable:
- Tried to unscrew the four screws at the back of the PingMaster to get into the hardware behind the PingMaster:
- Three of the four screws came out with no problem but one of the screws started trouble.
- One of the screws is threated and will not come out of the keyboard.
- After trying for one hour, the screw head is just a circle now.
- Started drilling into the screw and luckily the head of the screw popped off.
- There were scuffs on the plastic, nothing bad, and the screw was destroyed but the IBM PingMaster was not destroyed and I can now access the back of the ringmaster.
- Connected the keyboard’s hardware to the converter but no output was coming through from the keyboard.
- It was later determined that the cable that connected the circuit board of the keyboard to the Pro Micro board. WTF!
- Tried to remove the thread of the broken screw but the thread would not come out and the thread of the broken screw was getting more broken from the pliers.
- I plugged everything back, cleaned the inside of the keyboard, and put everything back but with one of the screws missing ahead.

### October  2019:
- I took the IBM PingMaster apart again, this time it came easier to me because I knew what to do. But it is still a bit difficult due to the threaded part of the broken screw still being there.
- I replaced the female to female cables for the Pro Micro and I did a double heat shrink on the female to female cables that connect to the pins in the IBM PingMaster. I did not heat shrink the end of the female to female cables that connect to the Pro Micro board.  
- I then connected one of the silver micro USB cables to the Pro Micro board.
- After all of this, I wrapped the Pro Micro board with electric tape and stuffed it into the top right corner of the insides of the Pro Micro board. 
- After converting to the new cable, everything worked but I ran into an issue. The speaker/beeper kept making a hissing noise. I later learned that this was due to some current going to the speaker/beeper which is making it make a missing noise. To fix this, I made a new extension cable for the speaker/beeper using female to male cables as well as a resistor (something under 330 Ohms). I also did the heat shrinking tactics to this new cable as I did for the cable that connected the Pro Micro board to the PingMaster.
- The tape under the rubber “feet” trick did not work with the PingMaster. So I used some Felt Pads instead. It did raise the PingMaster a bit but its nothing too bad.
- The Felt Pads works great, but the Felt Pads on the raising feet fall off here and there. I plan on fixing this but using better and a little bit more Felt Pads.

## *Plans for the future:*
1) Remove the broken threaded screw from the keyboard.
2) Replace the broken threaded screw with a new one, you still have the Clip-Washer and Screw-Washer from the original screw, so you just need to screw itself.
3) Replace the Screw, Clip-Washer, and Screw-Washer for holding the ground cable of the original 4-pin VGA cable. You already found a screw that kind of replaces the old one, but it’s not perfect. 
4) DEEP clean the keyboard.
5) Re-Program some parts of the keyboard layout for the Pro Micro.

## Current Review of my IBM PingMaster:
#### *Pros:*
- The overall look and design of the IBM PingMaster is really nice and looks great for my future setup. 
- The Vintage-Green-Switches (VGS) feels great. They are linear switches with are pretty loud and give a spring/vibrating like noise every time it’s pressed. It makes a unique sound and the springs themselves do have great quality.
- The overall build quality of the keyboard is really great. It is strong and feels premium.  
- Their area lot of keys on the PingMaster and thanks to the Pro Micro board, those keys can all the used and programmed to do whatever someone whats.
#### *Cons:*
- The OG cable is too heavy and tough. Luckily I fixed this by replacing that cable with a threaded micro USB to USB 3 cable. 
- The color of the keyboard, I personally love, but it is not the best color for most setups. 
- I HATTED how for my model, one screw that was screwed in so tight that it got threaded as I tried to remove it. This resulted in me breaking the head of this screw off and leave the threaded part of that screw inside the case in the hopes of not damaging the keyboard any further.
